Internationalization
====================

This part of the documentation covers the localization and translation of Bitmask.
Because we want to *bring fire to the people*, in as many countries and languages as possible.

Translating Bitmask PySide Application

For translators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We are using `transifex <http://transifex.com/projects/p/bitmask>`_ to coordinate translation efforts. If you want to contribute, just sign up there and send us your translations.


Translating help documents
--------------------------

There are two sets of online documents that need translation. One is
https://leap.se/docs, and the other is https://bitmask.net/help. Both are
maintained in git repos (`leap.se <https://github.com/leapcode/leap_se/tree/master/pages/docs>`_ and `bitmask.net <https://github.com/leapcode/bitmask_help>`_).

In the repo for bitmask.net there are some explanations about how to contribute
to those repos (using the online github editor, or using git directly).


Human interaction
-----------------
We're hanging out in the #leap channel on the freenode network. There's also a
spanish channel at #bitmask-es.
