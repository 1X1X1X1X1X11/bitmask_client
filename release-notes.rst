0.9.2 April XY - "Panis et Circenses"
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We were very pleased to announce Bitmask stable 0.9.2 

This is a minor release and you can see changes on `the changelog`_.

Using the latest Bitmask, Linux users will be able to use our encrypted email
service, now in beta state! An alpha version for OSX is also available.

Currently we have a test provider for mail @ https://mail.bitmask.net This
provider is already bundled with Bitmask for easy access on the wizard. Please
help us test this and file bug reports here:

[Pixelated integration news]

The standalone bundles for 0.9.2 include statically compiled binaries for
OpenVPN 2.3.10 (compiled against PolarSSL 1.3.9) and GnuPG 1.4.20.

NOTE: beta means that we expect things not to break but we don't promise you
won't get any headaches or lose some email, so please be careful.
