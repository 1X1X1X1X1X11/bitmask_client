ANNOUNCING Bitmask 0.9.0rc4 release candidate

The LEAP team is pleased to announce  the immediate  availability of Bitmask
0.9.0rc4.

This is the fourth public *release candidate* of the Bitmask client that
supports our user friendly end to end encrypted mail service. Our work has
focused on speed and scale optimization by adapting the underlying components
(leap.keymanager and leap.mail) to use the new async API of Soledad. This
reduces code complexity by making use of the reactor pattern and by having
blocking code (i.e. general i/o) be executed asynchronously. We have revamped
how bitmask frontend and backend communicates (this improves performance and
prevent bugs), improved log handling for better bug reports, and much more (see
the changelog file for a more detailed list).

This is a release candidate aimed at getting more user feedback to influence
our next round of development. We have a list of known issues that we are
cranking through and will add more to the list as they come in.
