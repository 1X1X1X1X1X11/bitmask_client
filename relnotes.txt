ANNOUNCING LEAP Client, the internet encryption toolkit, v0.2.0

The LEAP team is pleased to announce the immediate
availability of version 0.2.0 of LEAP Client

https://leap.se/downloads/leap-client

LEAP (LEAP Encryption Access Project) develops a plan to secure
everyday communication, breaking down into discrete services.

The client for the current phase gives support to the EIP Service.
EIP (the Encrypted Internet Proxy) provides circumvention,
location anonymization, and traffic encryption in a hassle-free,
automatically self-configuring fashion.

You can read the user manual and the developer notes online at:

http://leap-client.readthedocs.org

This is the first testing release for the LEAP Client, and it
is by no means intended for real production use. Especially you
are encouraged to not provide any kind of sensitive password during
your registration process. 

See the NEWS file for more details.


WHAT CAN THIS VERSION OF THE CLIENT DO FOR ME?

You can connect to the EIP service offered by a provider of your
choice, and enjoy a encrypted internet connection.

The first run wizard allows to register an user with the selected
provider, downloading all the config files needed to connect to the
eip service. There are also some minimal network checks in place.


LICENCE

You may use this package under the GNU General Public License,
version 3 or, at your option, any later version. See the file
"COPYING.GPL" for the terms of the GNU General Public

INSTALLATION

The current version of the LEAP Client has been tested on GNU/Linux
and OSX, but it is likely that you are able to run it under other
systems, specially if you are skillful and patient is one of your
virtues.

Have a look at "docs/user/install.rst".

Packages are provided for debian and ubuntu. OSX and win installers
will be following soon.

intensive bug-reeducation program.


HACKING

If you are lucky enough, you can spot us sleepless in night trains,
rooftops, rainforests, and beyond any border.
